# To represent coordinates of point, method 1 : two variables

coordinateX = 9.04
coordinateY = 56

# instead we can use a tuple

# tuple syntax : ()

# 1.
coordinate1 = (9.04,56)

print(coordinate1)


# 2. 

coordinate2 = (34,-1,45)

print(coordinate2)






# Note : used for one unit that has many parts

# tuples are immutable, you cannot add items to it too.
